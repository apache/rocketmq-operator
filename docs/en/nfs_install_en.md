## Deploy NFS Service 

This document will show you how to simply deploy the NFS shared storage service on your Kubernetes cluster with an example.

### Install NFS Server

Choose one of your nodes to install the NFS service, assuming our shared data directory is: ```/data/k8s```

1. Turn off the firewall (requires sudo privileges)

```shell
$ systemctl stop firewalld.service

$ systemctl disable firewalld.service
```

2. Install and configure NFS

```shell
$ yum -y install nfs-utils rpcbind
```

3. Set permissions for the shared directory:

```shell
$ chmod 755 /data/k8s/
```

4. Configure NFS. The default configuration file for NFS is under ```/etc/exports```. Add the following configuration information to the file:

```shell
$ vi /etc/exports
/data/k8s  *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
```

5. Start rpcbind service:

```shell
$ systemctl start rpcbind.service

$ systemctl enable rpcbind

$ systemctl status rpcbind
···
Sep 16 10:27:19 master systemd[1]: Started RPC bind service.
```

If you see the above output, the rpcbind is successfully started.

6. Start NFS service:

```shell
$ systemctl start nfs.service

$ systemctl enable nfs

$ systemctl status nfs
···
Sep 16 10:28:01 master systemd[1]: Started NFS server and services.
```

If you see the above output, the NFS server is successfully started.

It can also be confirmed by the following command:

```shell
$ rpcinfo -p | grep nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   tcp   2049  nfs
    100227    3   tcp   2049  nfs_acl
    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   udp   2049  nfs
    100227    3   udp   2049  nfs_acl
```

So here we have the NFS server installed, then we install the NFS service on the other nodes.

### Install NFS Clients

Install NFS on the other nodes of your Kubernetes cluster:

1. Turn off the firewall first:

```shell
$ systemctl stop firewalld.service

$ systemctl disable firewalld.service
```

2. Install NFS 

```shell
$ yum -y install nfs-utils rpcbind
```

3. As with the above method, start rpc first, then start NFS:

```shell
$ systemctl start rpcbind.service 

$ systemctl enable rpcbind.service 

$ systemctl start nfs.service    

$ systemctl enable nfs.service
```

4. After the client startup is complete, check if NFS has a shared directory:

```shell
$ showmount -e 192.168.130.32
Export list for 192.168.130.32:
/data/k8s *
```

Where ```192.168.130.32``` is the node IP where your NFS server is located.
